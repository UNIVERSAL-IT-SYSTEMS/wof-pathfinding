## Path Finding

Pathfinding is an algorithm that handles turning a [specifically created SVG map](http://ms-iot.github.io/windows-on-fridges/webservices/map/) into a graph and running greedy serach on the graph to find the shortest path between two points on the map.
The package includes both files for running algorithm locally (wof-pathfinding.exe and Main.cs), testing it locally ("test" folder), and running it on Azure Cloud Service.
more information about setting up pathfinding is on http://ms-iot.github.io/windows-on-fridges/webservices/pathfinding/.
